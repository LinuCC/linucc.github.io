    Babesk is a cashless ordering system for school canteens, started 2010 in a computer science project group in school.
    With time the amount of active contributors decreased, while interest in the program itself increased.
    Soon I had the role as project lead.
    I implemented a framework allowing modularity for parts of the system and access control for groups of users.
    This led to many additional Modules.
    Schbas, for example, is a system for book lending in school and is a joint effort by the computer science project group.
    Kuwasys is a system with which pupils can choose their courses, programmed by me.
    The system is used by some schools in Lower Saxony, Germany.
